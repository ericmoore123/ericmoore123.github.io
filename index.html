						<h4>The Origin of 3D Virtual Environments</h4>
						<p class="stand-out"><strong>In this section, we cover the origin of Virtual Environments and some of their early applications.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What are 3D virtual environments?</h4>
						<p>A Virtual Environment is defined as <em class="stand-out">"A central interface the software that creates an interactive and immersive experience for administrators and users"</em>.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Can you guess what the most common applicaton of 3D virtual environments are? </p>
						<h4 class="fragment fade-up stand-out">Video Games!</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>When did the first signs of virtual experiences surface?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1960's</em> : Electro-mechanical games called Periscope and Crown Special Soccer within arcade environments.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1970's - 1980</em> : Atari releases multiple games and take the gaming world by storm, allowing for virtual arcade integration into bars, malls, etc.</p>
								- This now meant that virtual environments could have both entertainment and social value within gaming/social cultures. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">Early 1980's</em> : The personal computer is introduced allowing creating potential for the internet and networked collaboration through software systems.</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/arcade.png">
						<h4>Arcades and their Social Implications</h4>
						<p>Take a look at the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWevidSFyjY&ab_channel=PatrickScottPatterson" target="_blank" class="stand-out">HERE</a>.</p>
						<p>This video, highlighting a mirade of arcade environments from the 1980's, is a good example as to how popular these virtual interactions were.</p>
						<p class="stand-out">These arcades provided:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fun social interaction;</li>
							<li>Education on new technologies;</li>
							<li>Exposure into newly created immersive entertainment;</li>
							<li>Spark interest within young people for the world of virtual technologies;</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Arcades and their Social Implications Cont.</h4>
						<p class="stand-out">As evident throughout history, video games and their interactive environments led to entertainment for the masses!</p>
						<img src="./images/video-game-sales-graph.png" alt="The evolution of vieo game sales">
						<p>As clearly evident by this graph, demand for video games has nearly always been able to keep up pace with the amount released. We see a particularly large spike towards the mid 2000's in both interest and demand.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>So..... What comes next?</h4>
						<p>Surely, arcades alone can't be responsible for this growth right?</p>
						<h2 class="stand-out fragment dafe-up" style="color: rgb(216, 48, 48);"><em>Correct!</em></h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/old-computer.png">
						<h4>The Year of the Computer!</h4>
						<p>The year was 1982, and TIME Magazine took a contravercial stance by choosing a "machine of the year", rather than a "man of the year".</p>
						<p>Their yearly piece came out at a time when PC sales were rapidely increasing, dubbing the timeframe a name of: "The PC Revolution!"</p>
						<p>This title properly fit the time period due to the crazy sales numbers of personal PC computers. <br><br> <b class="stand-out">In 1982, over 3 million units were sold!</b></p>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/web.png">
						<h4>The Internet</h4>
						<p>Now a days, the internet can seem like a scary place, but the internet started out as a military project in the late 20th century. When the web turned open source, the internet introduced the world to a land of virtual connectivity!</p>
						<p>Suddenly, the possibility of virtual multiplayer games and conjoined interconnected systems became a very real possibility.</p>
						<p class="stand-out"><b>Some of the earliest online games include:</b></p>
						<ul class="fragment fade-up">
							<li>SGI Dogfight</li>
							<li>XTrek</li>
							<li>Pathway to Darkness</li>
							<li>Doom</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Summary</h4>
						<p>In this section, we covered just some of the ways 3D technology and an interest in its first advancements were sparked within our culture. From the first video game consoles where in-person multiplayer became possible, to the first personal computers coming out and opening up a world of interconnected opportunity, we see these events impacts in our daily lives.</p>

					<section data-background-image="./images/vr.png">
						<h4>The Technological Evolution of <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> <br>(Arguably the most popular type of interactive 3D environment system ever)</h4>
						<p class="stand-out"><strong>In this section, we will delve into the history of one of the most intriguing 3D environments we have available to us today.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What is Virtual Reality?</h4>
						<p>Virtual Reality:</p>
						<p class="stand-out fragment fade-up">The computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What is Virtual Reality? Cont.</h4>
						<p>Now, in the 21st century, we commonly see virtual reality headsets and large game companies come out with games solely tailored for their use.</p>
						<p>But, where did these decives start? For that answer, we need to go back to the mid 20th century to a cinematographer named ...</p>
						<h4 class="fragment fade-up" style="color: rgb(216, 48, 48);" ><b>Morton Heilig</b></h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Sensorama</h4>
							<div class="side-by-side">
								<div>
									<p><em>Morton Heilig</em>, a cinematographer, created the first virtual reality experience for public consumption called “Sensorama". It resembled a mix between an eye exam machine and a photobooth. There were 6 short films created where users would be bombarded with stimuli at certain points in the presentations.</p>
									<p class="stand-out">This relatively primative device was the first publically available virtual reality experience!</p>
								</div>
								<img style="margin: 0 0 0 50px" width="400px" src="./images/sensorama.jpg" alt="">
							</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Morton Heilig Cont.</h4>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<div>
								<p>Later into the 1960's, Morton Heilig was at it again, creating what one of the worlds first head-mounted masks!</p>
								<p>This mask coined the name of "The Telesphere Mask" and contained wide-vision, sterio quality sound and adjustable components to better fit a users head!</p>
								<p class="stand-out"><b>Some modern VR headsets can't even manage that!</b></p>
							</div>
							<img style="margin: 0 0 0 50px" width="400px" src="./images/mask.jpg" alt="">
						</div>
						<p>It is safe to say that Morton Heilig set the stage for advanced Virtual Reality technology to become a reality.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Military Introduction</h4>
						<p>As we moved through the 1960's, we see the military take particular interest in head tracking and flight training implementations of this technology.</p>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<img src="./images/headsight.png" alt="">
							<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
								<p>Two engineers named Comeau and Bryan created the first motion tracking head mounted display with built in video screens for each eye and a head tracking system. <br><br>
								<b class="stand-out">This was not virtual reality however. It allowed to look at remote, hazardous situations. A remote camera imitated the head movements so the user could look around the setting.</b></p>		
							</div>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Birth of the Concept: Virtual Reality</h4>
						<p>In 1965, the scientist Ivan Sutherland, presented his vision of the "<em class="stand-out">Ultimate Display</em>". The concept was of a virtual world viewed through an HMD which replicated reality so well that the user would not be able to differentiate from actual reality.</p>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<p><em>“The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.”</em></p>
							<img src="./images/philco.jpg" alt="" width="450px" style="margin-left: 20px;">
						</div>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/simulator1.png">
						<h4>Simulation and Simulators!</h4>
						<p>In 1966, Military engineer <em class="stand-out">Thomas A. Furness</em> III created a flight simulator. It was created specifically for training purposes for the U.S. Air Force</p>
						<p>This project was specifically valuable to the evolution of this kind of technology due to the amount of funding provided by the U.S. military.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Interactivity!</h4>
						<p>Moving forward to the mid 1970's, the first interactive virtual reality platform was created. It was displayed at the Milwaukee Art Center and dubbed the name "<em class="stand-out">VIDEOPLACE</em>".</p>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<img src="./images/VIDEOPLACE.jpg" alt="" width="650px">
							<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The simplistic system used a combination of cameras, projectors and sensors to generate silhouettes that immitate a users actions.</p>
						</div>
						<p class="stand-out">VIDEOPLACE set a precedent for what interactive systems were possible with virtual reality.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Gaming Made Possible</h4>
					 	<p>Moving through the 1980's and into the early 1990's, we see a VR system released to drive the Mars Rover called Virtuality. These were the first mass-produced VR systems.</p>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<img src="./images/vr-early.jpg" alt="" width="600px">
							<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
								<p>This initial invention showed the public the gaming industry was a viable domain for virtual reality technology.</p>
								<p class="stand-out">Unfortunately, the device never really took off and is known as an innovative VR device created two decades too early.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Advancements!</h4>
						<p>The most common type of VR innovation through the majority of the 1990's were large game companies taking cracks at developing gaming headsets.</p>
						<div class="side-by-side" >
							<div class="side-by-side">
								<img src="./images/vfx1.jpg" alt="" width="600px">
								<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
									<p class="stand-out">Some of these companies include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Nintendo</li>
										<li>SEGA</li>
										<li>VictorMaxx</li>
										<li>Virtual IO</li>
										<li>Forte</li>
									</ul>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>The 2000's Lull</h4>
						<p>Virtual Reality innovation took a back seat to tradition media with the introduction of advanced cell phones, larg-scale internet services and big-screen televisions. Suddenly, there was no real interest in virtual reality innovation from a consumer stand-point.</p>
						<img src="./images/phones.jpg" width="600px">

						<h4>
							Software Implementations
						</h4>
						<p>Between 2000 and 2010, we see a real shortage of game-related Virtual Reality integration into tech markets. Instead, large companies such as Google move towards practical implementation of VR technologies.</p>
						<div class="side-by-side">
							<div>
								<p class="stand-out">Google implements two technologies. Google Street-View and Stereoscopic 3D Street View from 2007 to 2010.</p>
								<p>These technologies proved to users worldwide how virtual reality could be implemented into their daily lives.</p>

						<h4>
							Modern Headsets
						</h4>
						<p>2012 marked the start of the return in the VR gaming industry. The launch of the Oculus Rift Kickstarter and its purchase by Facebook for over <b class="stand-out">2 Billion dollars</b> in 2014 was a verificational stamp of approval for the resurgence of VR gaming.</p>

					<section data-background-image="./images/vr-new.png">
						<h4>Modern Headsets Cont.</h4>
						<p>By 2016 hundreds of companies were developing VR products. Most of the headsets had dynamic binaural audio.</p>
						<p>Most gaming headsets used a combination of touch and haptic interfaces. <red class="stand-out">Haptic interfaces are systems that allow humans to interact with a computer using their touch and movements.</red></p>
						<p>Companies leading the charge while developing their own VR headsets indlue: <b>HTC, Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Sony, Samsung</b></p>
