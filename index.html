						<h4>The Origin of 3D Virtual Environments</h4>
						<p class="stand-out"><strong>In this section, we cover the origin of Virtual Environments and some of their early applications.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What are 3D virtual environments?</h4>
						<p>A Virtual Environment is defined as <em class="stand-out">"A central interface the software that creates an interactive and immersive experience for administrators and users"</em>.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Can you guess what the most common applicaton of 3D virtual environments are? </p>
						<h4 class="fragment fade-up stand-out">Video Games!</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>When did the first signs of virtual experiences surface?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1960's</em> : Electro-mechanical games called Periscope and Crown Special Soccer within arcade environments.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1970's - 1980</em> : Atari releases multiple games and take the gaming world by storm, allowing for virtual arcade integration into bars, malls, etc.</p>
								- This now meant that virtual environments could have both entertainment and social value within gaming/social cultures. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">Early 1980's</em> : The personal computer is introduced allowing creating potential for the internet and networked collaboration through software systems.</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/arcade.png">
						<h4>Arcades and their Social Implications</h4>
						<p>Take a look at the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWevidSFyjY&ab_channel=PatrickScottPatterson" target="_blank" class="stand-out">HERE</a>.</p>
						<p>This video, highlighting a mirade of arcade environments from the 1980's, is a good example as to how popular these virtual interactions were.</p>
						<p class="stand-out">These arcades provided:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fun social interaction;</li>
							<li>Education on new technologies;</li>
							<li>Exposure into newly created immersive entertainment;</li>
							<li>Spark interest within young people for the world of virtual technologies;</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Arcades and their Social Implications Cont.</h4>
						<p class="stand-out">As evident throughout history, video games and their interactive environments led to entertainment for the masses!</p>
						<img src="./images/video-game-sales-graph.png" alt="The evolution of vieo game sales">
						<p>As clearly evident by this graph, demand for video games has nearly always been able to keep up pace with the amount released. We see a particularly large spike towards the mid 2000's in both interest and demand.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>So..... What comes next?</h4>
						<p>Surely, arcades alone can't be responsible for this growth right?</p>
						<h2 class="stand-out fragment dafe-up" style="color: rgb(216, 48, 48);"><em>Correct!</em></h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/old-computer.png">
						<h4>The Year of the Computer!</h4>
						<p>The year was 1982, and TIME Magazine took a contravercial stance by choosing a "machine of the year", rather than a "man of the year".</p>
						<p>Their yearly piece came out at a time when PC sales were rapidely increasing, dubbing the timeframe a name of: "The PC Revolution!"</p>
						<p>This title properly fit the time period due to the crazy sales numbers of personal PC computers. <br><br> <b class="stand-out">In 1982, over 3 million units were sold!</b></p>
					</section>
					<section data-background-image="./images/web.png">
						<h4>The Internet</h4>
						<p>Now a days, the internet can seem like a scary place, but the internet started out as a military project in the late 20th century. When the web turned open source, the internet introduced the world to a land of virtual connectivity!</p>
						<p>Suddenly, the possibility of virtual multiplayer games and conjoined interconnected systems became a very real possibility.</p>
						<p class="stand-out"><b>Some of the earliest online games include:</b></p>
						<ul class="fragment fade-up">
							<li>SGI Dogfight</li>
							<li>XTrek</li>
							<li>Pathway to Darkness</li>
							<li>Doom</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Summary</h4>
						<p>In this section, we covered just some of the ways 3D technology and an interest in its first advancements were sparked within our culture. From the first video game consoles where in-person multiplayer became possible, to the first personal computers coming out and opening up a world of interconnected opportunity, we see these events impacts in our daily lives.</p>

						<h4>History and Technological Evolution of Virtual Reality</h4>
						<p class="stand-out"><strong>In this section, we will delve into the history of one of the most intriguing 3D environments we have available to us today.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What is Virtual Reality?</h4>
						<p>Virtual Reality:</p>
						<p class="stand-out fragment fade-up">The computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What is Virtual Reality? Cont.</h4>
						<p>Now, in the 21st century, we commonly see virtual reality headsets and large game companies come out with games solely tailored for their use.</p>
						<p>But, where did these decives start? For that answer, we need to go back to the mid 20th century to a cinematographer named ...</p>
						<h4 class="fragment fade-up" style="color: rgb(216, 48, 48);" ><b>Morton Heilig</b></h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Sensorama</h4>
							<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center">
								<div>
									<p><em>Morton Heilig</em>, a cinematographer, created the first virtual reality experience for public consumption called â€œSensorama". It resembled a mix between an eye exam machine and a photobooth. There were 6 short films created where users would be bombarded with stimuli at certain points in the presentations.</p>
									<p class="stand-out">This relatively primative device was the first publically available virtual reality experience!</p>
								</div>
								<img style="margin: 0 0 0 50px" width="400px" src="./images/sensorama.jpg.crdownload" alt="">
							</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Morton Heilig Cont.</h4>
						<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center">
							<div>
								<p>Later into the 1960's, Morton Heilig was at it again, creating what one of the worlds first head-mounted masks!</p>
								<p>This mask coined the name of "The Telesphere Mask" and contained wide-vision, sterio quality sound and adjustable components to better fit a users head!</p>
								<p class="stand-out"><b>Some modern VR headsets can't even manage that!</b></p>
							</div>
							<img style="margin: 0 0 0 50px" width="400px" src="./images/mask.jpg" alt="">
						</div>
						<p>It is safe to say that Morton Heilig set the stage for advanced Virtual Reality technology to become a reality.</p>
