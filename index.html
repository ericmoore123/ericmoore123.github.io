						<h4>The Origin of 3D Virtual Environments</h4>
						<p class="stand-out"><strong>In this section, we cover the origin of Virtual Environments and some of their early applications.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>What are 3D virtual environments?</h4>
						<p>A Virtual Environment is defined as <em class="stand-out">"A central interface the software that creates an interactive and immersive experience for administrators and users"</em>.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Can you guess what the most common applicaton of 3D virtual environments are? </p>
						<h4 class="fragment fade-up stand-out">Video Games!</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>When did the first signs of virtual experiences surface?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1960's</em> : Electro-mechanical games called Periscope and Crown Special Soccer within arcade environments.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">1970's - 1980</em> : Atari releases multiple games and take the gaming world by storm, allowing for virtual arcade integration into bars, malls, etc.</p>
								- This now meant that virtual environments could have both entertainment and social value within gaming/social cultures. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><em class="stand-out">Early 1980's</em> : The personal computer is introduced allowing creating potential for the internet and networked collaboration through software systems.</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>

						<h4>Arcades and their Social Implications</h4>
						<p>Take a look at the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWevidSFyjY&ab_channel=PatrickScottPatterson" target="_blank" class="stand-out">HERE</a>.</p>
						<p>This video, highlighting a mirade of arcade environments from the 1980's, is a good example as to how popular these virtual interactions were.</p>
						<p class="stand-out">These arcades provided:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fun social interaction;</li>
							<li>Education on new technologies;</li>
							<li>Exposure into newly created immersive entertainment;</li>
							<li>Spark interest within young people for the world of virtual technologies;</li>
